Relax Challenge:
In this project I have investigated which factors are most important in determining user adoption.

Dataset: the dataset contains information about 8,823 users among which 1,656 are adopted users.

As per the analysis I found that the most important feature in determining user adoption is “total login time” i.e history of user the time from user signed up and user last login time.

Correlation between all the features in dataset

The other important feature is the ‘source of creation’. Users invited by other users and users signed up to do personal projects are more likely to be adopted users:
 
Percentage of adopted users with source of creation:

There are 22% of adopted who are invited by guests , 34% who are invited by some org and 10% who signed up for personal projects

Based on the above findings , I would recommend the good way to grow adopted users is to offer some incentives to users who once signed up to use the product and encourage existing users to invite others users .
